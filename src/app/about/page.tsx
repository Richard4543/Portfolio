        <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Hi there, Im Ricardo. I&apos;m a CSUS graduate with a Bachelor&apos;s in Computer Science, and I&apos;ve got a Software Engineering Certificate under my belt. I like to think of coding as a mix of art and science—a creative journey where every bug is just another puzzle waiting to be solved.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4">
            While I spend a lot of time immersed in code, I truly believe that collaboration is key. I thrive in environments where ideas flow freely , and every setback is just a stepping stone to something greater. With a minor in Mathematics sharpening my analytical edge, I embrace complexity with a smile.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4">
            At the heart of it all, I&apos;m driven by a desire to make a positive impact—whether that&apos;s streamlining workflows, designing user-friendly interfaces, or helping nurture new talent. 
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-700">
            Thanks for stopping by! I&apos;m always eager to connect, collaborate, and create something extraordinary.
        </p>
